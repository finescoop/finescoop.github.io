'I adored Ruth profoundly, yet I was unable to disregard what she had done. It was detestable to me that she could take from a weak individual and I needed to report her.'

Antony, 61, a microbiologist, met Fort while he was learning at Liverpool college. They started dating in May 2008 and experienced passionate feelings for over a common enthusiasm for music.

Antony says: 'One evening, in August 2018, I got Ruth from work and she let me know she'd taken one of the consideration home inhabitants out shopping that day.

'She said the woman, who was in a wheelchair, had £98,000 in her ledger. Something in the manner she talked just made my heart sink. I understood Ruth should approach the card and pin number.

'There was something else to it, however I started stressing, despite the fact that I had no great explanation to. It was a sense.'

In November 2018, Antony booked a family occasion to Mexico and while they were away, Fort started sprinkling the money.

He says: 'Ruth was muttering about cash and when I woke up, I saw the tote on the floor with a couple of notes dropped out. I got up to return them, and in her tote, I saw the check card.

'Everything fit properly, and I felt totally nauseated. I could barely handle it. At the point when Ruth woke up, I faced her, and she conceded everything. I advised her to gather her sacks and leave. It was shocking, I adored her, but then I realized I had no real option except to report her.'

Late in December 2018, Antony went to the police and Fort was captured before long. She showed up under the steady gaze of Preston Crown Court in February 2021.

Antony says: 'When the case became public there was repugnance in our town. My family truly endured accordingly. I had made the best choice but I was being decided close by Ruth.'
