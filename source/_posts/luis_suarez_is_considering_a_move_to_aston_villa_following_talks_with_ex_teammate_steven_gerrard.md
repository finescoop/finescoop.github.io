Suarez - who scored 21 objectives in Atletico's LaLiga win last term - has scored only nine of every 27 appearances this season, remembering an objective dry spell for his last 10 games.

In any case, in spite of his absence of structure before objective, supervisor Diego Simeone focused on Suarez stays a vital figure at the Spanish capital side.
