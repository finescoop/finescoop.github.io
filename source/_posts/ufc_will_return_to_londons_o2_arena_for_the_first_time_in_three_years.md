The UFC is set for a tremendous re-visitation of London on March 19, three years on from its last appearance, before the Covid pandemic started.

The MMA association affirmed on Wednesday that it will arrange a Fight Night at The O2 Arena in about two months, their twelfth live occasion in the British capital in its set of experiences.

It is whenever the UFC first has arranged an occasion in London since UFC Fight Night 147 on March '6, 2019, when Jorge Masvidal hushed the majority after fiercely taking out Liverpool's Darren Till.

The UFC last held an occasion in the capital in March 2019, when Masvidal took out Till

Tyron Woodley was planned to take on Birmingham's Leon Edwards at UFC Fight Night 171 in March 2020 however the occasion was dropped inferable from the Covid pandemic.

UFC president Dana White has taken pleasure in the most recent declaration, uncovering he 'can hardly wait' to encounter the 'mind blowing' climate London brings to the table.

'Each time we put on an occasion in London it's an amazing encounter,' he said.

'The fans are mind boggling, and the battles are dependably out of this world. It's an alternate sort of energy in England. What's more I can hardly wait to get back there with a battle card on March nineteenth.'

UFC president Dana White has indicated that rising star Paddy Pimblett could highlight on the card

White said he can't hold back to encounter London's 'staggering' climate in about two months

The March 19 card is probably going to include a lot of British and European-based warriors, with Tom Aspinall, Mike Grundy and Jack Shore set to battle in the capital.

Paddy Pimblett is likewise expected to venture into the Octagon at The O2. The lightweight made a shocking UFC debut last year and fans are eager to see The Baddy back in real life once more.

White said that Pimblett is set to take on rival Jared Gordon on March 19, albeit the Liverpudlian's supervisor, Graham Boylan, has demanded that no arrangement has been reached at this point.
