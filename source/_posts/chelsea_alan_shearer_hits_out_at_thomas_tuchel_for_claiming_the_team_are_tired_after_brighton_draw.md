Alan Shearer has hit back at Chelsea manager Thomas Tuchel for asserting his side were 'worn out' after their 1-1 draw with Brighton on Tuesday night - demanding the Blues ought to have fared better with a seat worth £220million.

Chelsea were dreary at the AMEX as they worked to an eighth draw of the period in one more blow for their expectations of winning the title, with Hakim Ziyech's initial long-range strike being offset by an Adam Webster header.

Ziyech scarcely responded in the wake of putting the group ahead, and Tuchel accepts his crew were too worn out to even think about evening celebrate to 'save energy'.

Shearer called attention to that Chelsea's seat was worth £220m and ought to have fared better

'Indeed, even in the response of the objective you can see we were drained. We were assuaged we had the objective yet it dislike the unadulterated euphoria since they are saving energy.

'That is my sensation existing apart from everything else and of the group at this moment.'

However, Shearer gave a searing reaction to the German's reason, saying each group in world football faces testing conditions as of now - and that Chelsea ought to be one of the most outstanding furnished groups to manage exhaustion because of the profundity in their crew and how much cash they have spread out.

'Try not to acknowledge that, I'm not having that,' Shearer told BT Sport.

Shearer accepts the genuine justification behind Chelsea's helpless presentation was because of an absence of certainty

'I get it's been a difficult stretch for each football club on the planet, they've all had undeniably challenging conditions, as has everybody, not simply football.

'Yet, he has a seat this evening that is worth £220million. Kovacic, Havertz, Werner, Pulisic… [Tuchel] forgot about Mount on Saturday, brought Mount back in this evening.'

All things considered, Shearer feels the Blues are lacking in certainty and scrutinized the solidarity in the dressing rooom after Ziyech's surly reaction to scoring prior to being engaged with a warmed conversation with Romelu Lukaku.

'That presentation, absolutely going ahead, was not a worn out exhibition,' he added.

'That exhibition going ahead was a group that is truly battling on certainty and I don't know that they're all in total agreement.

'That for me is the reason it was a terrible showing.'
