This is the second a couple of rush looking for base jumpers sent off themselves from a 3280ft high bluff face into an overcast void on a solitary parachute.

Tom Newberry, 32, and Callum Coldwell-Story, recorded themselves hopping from one of the pinnacles of Mount Brento, Italy.

Film shows the pair, who recorded themselves with an Insta360 One X appended to Tom's protective cap, as they become encircled by thick mists and mist.

After they hopped Callum slid down to hang from Tom's legs, prior to grasping his hand and afterward giving up to freefall into the void.

Tom had an Insta360 One X connected to his cap which offered a perspective on all the activity

They were playing out a trick known as a 'Mr Bill', where two skydivers fly on a similar parachute.

Seconds in the wake of hopping Callum directed his parachute away from the bluff face and out towards the darkened valley.

When the pair cleared the cloud, the valley opened up underneath them and Callum started to move himself, unfastening himself from the tackle.

He slid down Tom's legs and hung in the air prior to talking his hand and giving up and falling quickly towards the earth.

Minutes before the finish of the video it is feasible to see the little spot of Callum's parachute far beneath.

Tom, an instructor from Exeter, Devon, said: 'We had been in Italy preparing our abilities prior to making a beeline for the Swiss Alps.

'Towards the week's end we needed to accomplish something more fun so we concocted the arrangement, no thought whether or not it would work.

'As you can see from the gigantic grins, loads of fun was had on this leap!'

The recording, which has as of late arisen on the web, was shot on September 17 last year.

Minutes in the wake of giving up, Callum vanished from view into the valley beneath
