New Zealand's restricted overs visit through Australia has been delayed endlessly because of vulnerability over when the guests would have the option to get back because of COVID-19 conventions, the cricket sheets of the two nations said on Wednesday.

The visit, booked for Jan. 24-Feb. 9, included three one-day internationals in Perth, Hobart and Sydney and a singular Twenty20 match in Canberra.

New Zealand Cricket (NZC) and Cricket Australia (CA) said they were examining when the installations could be played.

New Zeakand's forthcoming visit through Australia has been delayed endlessly because of Covid-19

'As we currently know, the approach of Omicron provoked a shift in perspective from the NZ government, bringing about a hard 10-day required disengagement period being forced on all approaching voyagers,' NZC Chief Executive David White said.

'NZC and CA had investigated a proposition to extend the visit and to push out the date on which the crew may get back to New Zealand with the expectation that may be more attainable for the public authority.

'Sadly, we got guidance toward the beginning of today that they couldn't give conviction over this.'

There was no conviction on when New Zealand would have the option to get back after the visit

NZC and CA said conversations were proceeding over when the delayed apparatuses will be played.

CA said ticket buyers would be discounted and it will affirm the timetable for the group's T20 Internationals against Sri Lanka one month from now quickly.

Australia are booked to play five T20s against Sri Lanka from Feb. 11.

'We realize fans will be disillusioned and express gratitude toward them for their agreement given the remarkable conditions that the worldwide pandemic presents for everybody,' CA CEO Nick Hockley said.
