Mercedes boss Toto Wolff knows his campaigning of race chief Michael Masi was 'unsatisfactory' when attempting to prevent the wellbeing vehicle from being conveyed in the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, says Martin Brundle.

Sky Sports intellectual Brundle, a previous F1 driver for McLaren and Jordan, was referring to a specific point in last month's season finale when Wolff attempted to keep a wellbeing vehicle from being conveyed after Antonio Giovinazzi's vehicle bankrupt down.

Brundle was likewise talking all the more extensively concerning how group managers, including Wolff and Red Bull rival Christian Horner, had been attempting to impact Masi's choices all through the season, with discussions between the two communicated for fans interestingly.

Those calls were uplifted on the last lap of the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix - the last race of the period - with Masi accused of twisting the standards to permit Max Verstappen the opportunity to beat Lewis Hamilton in a one-lap shootout.

Furthermore Brundle accepts the game should get back to the dynamic under previous race chief, the late Charlie Whiting.

'100%,' Brundle said on Sky Sports' Abu Dhabi: One Month On show while discussing on the off chance that groups campaigning the FIA should stop.

'In the main Safety Car occurrence when [Antonio] Giovinazzi's Alfa Romeo stalled some way from an assistance street, we had Toto on the radio to Masi saying "Hello Michael, no Safety Car", attempting to impact a security choice.

'[It's] totally unsatisfactory and Toto realizes that. We can't have that.

'What used to occur in the Herbie [Blash, previous agent race director] and Charlie days is they would get on the radio to Charlie and Herbie would go "He [Whiting] is occupied right now. He'll hit you up".

'Obviously, he didn't on the grounds that Charlie was caught up with figuring out the wreck that was on target and attempting to get when the race could be restarted.'

Wolff even advocated forbidding group directors approaching race control during races after he 'violated' in his enraged tirade at Masi in Abu Dhabi.

Wolff repeated calls from Ross Brawn, Formula 1's overseeing overseer of motorsports, for a boycott as he feels supervisors, for example, himself have gone too far.

Furthermore Brundle concurs with the pair, saying those calls were the absolute most 'awkward' parts of the period.

Wolff needs to see Masi eliminated from his job before the beginning of the 2022 season in Bahrain in March. At the present time, each question in F1 circles encompassed the eventual fate of Hamilton and regardless of whether he will return after such a petulant loss.

Since missing out on the title on the last lap to Red Bull rival Verstappen, Hamilton, 37, has declined to focus on seeing out the rest of his two-year agreement with Mercedes, which is worth in the locale of £70million.

Mercedes recently pulled out their legitimate activity against the overseeing FIA, accepting they got no opportunity of winning an allure on the premise it would require the FIA to topple their own stewards at additional extraordinary harm to the game.

However, Mercedes, the 2021 constructors' heroes, requested the intensive examination that is at present being completed to fix F1's uprightness following the disaster in Abu Dhabi.

Masi can't proceed as race chief since he 'has caused a lot of harm' and trust has 'absolutely vanished' in his judgment, trusts previous race driver Johnny Herbert.

'I think he has caused an excess of harm to Formula 1 and I think in light of the fact that about the place that he's in, we must have trust,' Herbert told Sky F1. 'I feel that trust has totally and absolutely vanished.'

In any case, Brundle isn't completely certain difference in one man is the arrangement, accepting that dumping Masi doesn't 'tackle the issue' as he pushes for more noteworthy change.

Brundle said: 'This is too enormous of a task for one individual to deal with this in a 23-race season, it's simply going to develop. Masi, assuming he stays, needs a great deal of help around him and I presume that is the thing they're taking a gander at right now.'
