'The most weak youngsters are the kids we should get into school, and we want to be familiar with them and have any familiarity with their lives.'

A Department for Education representative said: 'Our main concern keeps on being supporting all youngsters to go to the everyday schedule. Our participation partnership unites public pioneers to spread best practice to further develop participation right the nation over.

'They will be liable for ensuring everybody chipping away at the ground with kids, as an instructor, football trainer, psychological wellness specialist or in some other job, has the apparatuses and assets they need to separate obstructions to youngsters going to class.'
