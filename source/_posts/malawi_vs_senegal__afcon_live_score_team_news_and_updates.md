Malawi punched well over their weight there. In excess of 100 groups separate the two in the FIFA rankings however it looked far nearer than that. A VAR actually take a look at denied them a punishment in what ended up being the greatest second in the game however this drag attract has been to the point of owning Senegal.

Malawi should hold on to check whether they can go through as one of the most outstanding third spot groups. Senegal are edging towards capability on top of the gathering without having played especially well once more.

87 mins: The previous Bristol City man chests it down, turns and volleys yet Thom is fortunate the shot is straight down his throat. He's battling with a physical issue yet needs to see this one out for his side.

83 mins: Malawi are pressing the back with players and keeping the spaces little, making it hard for Senegal, who miss the mark on truly inventive player. The corner circles long and past any of Sarr's partners, permitting the minnows to crush it clear.

Would Senegal be able to observe a late champ as they did against Zimbabwe in the opener?

It was anything but a plunge however it was really delicate that the arbitrator has chosen to upset it. The hand was on the shoulder of the Malawi player yet he went down without any problem. The Malawi players are destroyed with that choice.

A flooding assault down the left for Malawi. There's not an enormous measure of contact and the arbitrator will really look at this one, or rather his VAR group will. Presently he's being told to examine the screen.

71 mins: Just when it looked like Senegal had the proportion of this group, Malawi send off their very own few attacks to sting them to their faculties. Pape Gueye and Diehiou are into the activity for Senegal.

Malawi need new legs in the event that they will hold around here - Senegal have influenced the energy and exhaustion could very much come into it as sunset falls in Cameroon.

50 mins: Brilliant reflexes from the Malawi guardian to spill a Diallo header. He folds at the resulting corner yet they scramble it away. There's better direness about Senegal, there couldn't have been any less to be reasonable.

Koulibaly, Gueye and Mane need to show others how its done. Gueye has been chopped down in an awkward test and is being treated on the pitch for what resembles a calf injury.

Not by and large a vintage half of football. Malawi are accomplishing something beyond disappointing Senegal and have been the better side. Zimbabwe are ahead against Guinea so the Lions of Taranga can relax... for the time being.

Senegal have scarcely had a sniff, simply that Mane possibility. They won't go far in this competition playing like this. It has been a trudge and despite the fact that they're as yet on course to qualify, this has been poor.

38 mins: The Napoli community back needs two or three games to arrive at full match wellness and Mhango nearly makes him look exceptionally absurd, hooking onto a through ball however bungling the opportunity to wrap up.

They've gone from Dakar and all around Senegal to help their group and the fans are giving a rambunctious setting, presently they need the group to match their result.

27 mins: The PSG midfielder endeavors to drop one on Diallo's toe preposterous and it appeared to be a wonderful drifted ball yet ran out of play, they're back in the domination without making anything obvious.

22 mins: Senegal need to shock into life, they look half sleeping however marshal one more fair raid down the right. There are two men in the case however the cross can track down the goalkeeper, helpless conveyance.

17 mins: Great exertion from the Malawi striker, he interfaces well with his left foot and Mendy is at full stretch, assuaged to see the strike lift a few feet over the bar.

14 mins: This game has been even following 14 minutes, which isn't the manner in which it should look on the off chance that you're a Senegal fan. They have a lot of value through the spine of the group yet are looking battered with lost passes and no genuine cognizance about the manner in which they play.

He's needed game time obviously yet the Chelsea attendant just fluttered wildy at a high, balancing ball into the crate, simply figuring out how to clench hand it away from risk, not his tidiest work.

10 seconds: You never normally compose an update 10 seconds in yet Senegal go long from the start up and Mane grabs at a large portion of a possibility over the top, diverted out for a corner that fails miserably. An assertion of plan.

Tipped as victors, Senegal have complimented to misdirect in their initial two games and will consider today to be a day to light their mission in front of the knockout stages.

The players are out onto the pitch, start off surprisingly fast.

The Senegal fans are giving the commotion in the Kouekong Stadium in Bafoussam...

It's been a moderately sluggish beginning to the Africa Cup of Nations for Senegal, who have been to a great extent disappointed in their initial two games.

The Lions of Teranga required a 97-minute punishment from Sadio Mane to move beyond Zimbabwe in their initial game, while they were vigorously baffled in their 0-0 attract to Naby Keita's Guinea.

Malawi, in the interim, were beaten 1-0 by Guinea before Gabadinho Mhango, who plays for South African side Orlando Pirates, scored either side of half-time in their rebound prevail upon Zimbabwe.

The two sides will be hoping to get a knockout round spot yet need a positive outcome to accomplish it, or be left perspiring regarding how different groups in third-place admission.
