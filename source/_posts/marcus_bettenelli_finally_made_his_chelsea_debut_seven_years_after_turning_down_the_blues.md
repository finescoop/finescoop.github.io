At the point when Marcus Bettinelli made his Chelsea debut recently, it was an appearance that was seven years really taking shape.

The Blues initially showed interest in the goalkeeper in 2015, as they looked for rivalry for Thibaut Courtois; yet the overseer ruled against it at the time feeling that he hadn't played sufficient first-group matches at Fulham and required opportunity to create prior to taking such a jump.

Be that as it may, having initially turned down the chance to do the short switch across west London, Bettinelli has at long last wore Chelsea blue.

Who can say for sure if he adds to his presentation for the club after the 5-1 win over Chesterfield nine days prior.

Odds are good that he'll play once more, he actually has year and a half passed on to run on his agreement at Stamford Bridge.

However, Bettinelli can generally say he played for the European bosses, you can't remove that from him.

It wasn't excessively quite a while in the past that Bettinelli was in the England crew, obviously - Gareth Southgate calling him into his Euros capability party in 2019.

He'll need to require his global vocation to be postponed for the present, yet who can say for sure what the future brings.

For the present however, Bettinelli is completely centered around the season ahead - helping Edouard Mendy and Kepa Arrizabalaga in his job as a useful goalkeeper.

At the point when his agreement at Fulham terminated the previous summer, he had various proposals to be a No 1 in the Championship.

Be that as it may, after more than 250 profession games - and at 29 years old - Bettinelli obviously felt the best approach to tweaking his game was to prepare every day of the week with top notch goalkeepers, regardless of whether it implied forfeiting standard matches.

Notwithstanding turning down the chance of joining Chelsea in 2015, the interest kept on running behind the scenes.

Furthermore when Petr Cech connected in the late spring, Bettinelli's brain was made up.

Aston Villa made a methodology, however subsequent to addressing Cech and Carlo Cudicini there was no option but to press onward.

Preparing with Mendy and Kepa regular will add another aspect to his collection, if and when leaves Chelsea he'll do as such a superior goalkeeper.

For sure, Bettinelli is adequately youthful to pass on Chelsea to continue and turn out to be best option and have life span somewhere else.

However, that situation is something like year and a half down the line. Bettinelli has his sights fixed immovably on the present time and place.
