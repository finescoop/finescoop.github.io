<p>Ziyech covered his mouth while somewhere down in conversation with Lukaku - as his Belgian colleague signaled - their discussion proceeding with right down through to the Chelsea changing area, regardless of Chelsea going in with a lead.</p>

<p>Ziyech and Lukaku were both vigorously reprimanded after Chelsea's 1-0 misfortune to title rivals Manchester City last Saturday - with the last option as of late being compelled to apologize subsequent to giving a sensation meet with Italian media in which he conceded being troubled at the club.</p>

<p>Chelsea dropped more focuses in the title race as Adam Webster got a final part adjuster</p>

<p>'You see toward the end the response after the [final] whistle the arena celebrates [the draw] like a triumph. That is what you face.</p>

<p>'We really want our original capacity to beat these obstructions, at the time it's troublesome so no fault for the group, we took a stab at everything except you can see we are intellectually drained.</p>

<p>Some saw Ziyech's refusal to accept his colleagues and respond subsequent to scoring alluded to inconvenience inside, and previous Chelsea star Joe Cole said it 'didnt sit well'.</p>

<p>'This is what you play for,' Cole said on BT Sport. He's an incredible ability, he hasn't gotten straight down to business in the Premier League as it's altogether different to the Dutch association. However, the not celebrating... It doesn't sit well for him as a chap.</p>

<p>'On the off chance that he was in my group I'd say come on. You know when fellows are upset and they're not playing. However, in the event that I fall off the seat and score an objective, it's an arrival of energy.'</p>
