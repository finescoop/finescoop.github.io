<p>No doubt about it, Chelsea are stuck. Only one win from seven association matches makes sorry perusing. On this proof Thomas Tuchel has his work slice out in attempting to revive his hailing side. Some might highlight their impending Carabao Cup last and the reality they are as yet in the Champions League and FA Cup.</p>

<p>In any case, that is simply hiding their issues away from view. They are 12 focuses hapless of pioneers Manchester City after this, their title trusts dead examine the water. They'll wind up in a race for the main four - not the title - if they don't watch out.</p>

<p>'We are truly and intellectually drained you can see it in our presentation,' whined Tuchel, whose side have played six matches contrasted with Brighton's four in January.</p>

<p>Tuchel, who was apparently petulant after the game, uncovered he will give his players two days off prior to beginning arrangements for Sunday's down versus Tottenham.</p>

<p>Recreation of 'Iron Man' robot utilizing drive knapsack to fly</p>

<p>Brighton (3-3-2-1):</p>

<p>Sanchez 5; Veltman 7, Webster 8, Burn 7; Lamptey 7 (March 76), Gross 7 (Maupay 62), Alzate 6.5, Cucurella 7; Moder 7, Mac Allister 7; Welbeck 6.5 (Trossard 62, 7).</p>

<p>Subs not utilized: Scherpen, Caicedo, Roberts, McGill, Leonard, Ferguson.</p>

<p>Objective: Webster 60.</p>

<p>Booked: Burn.</p>

<p>Potter: 7.5</p>

<p>Chelsea (4-2-2-2):</p>

<p>Kepa 6.5; Azpilicueta 6.5, Silva 6.5, Rudiger 7, Alonso 6; Jorginho 6.5 (Kovacic 80), Kante 7; Ziyech 6.5 (Werner 81), Mount 6; Lukaku 5.5 (Havertz 80), Hudson-Odoi 6.</p>

<p>Subs not utilized: Pulisic, Loftus-Cheek, Bettinelli, Saul, Sarr, Hall.</p>

<p>Objective: Ziyech 28.</p>

<p>Booked: Alonso, Rudiger</p>

<p>Tuchel: 6.5</p>

<p>Official: Kevin Friend - 6</p>

<p>Also in decency, it's hard not to feel compassion toward Tuchel. His group's timetable has been overwhelming - however that is the cost of accomplishment. His complaints about weariness will fail to receive any notice with those in the halls of force at Chelsea.</p>

<p>Their beginning here in Brighton was positively fatigued, Jakub Moder terminated barely wide in the third moment when the Poland star ought to have basically hit the objective.</p>

<p>While Chelsea were obviously battling, their adversaries were fantastic during the initial trades: simple on the eye and overflowing with innovation.</p>

<p>Marcos Alonso's unsafe and unnecessary rush on Tariq Lamptey in the case gave Chelsea one more alarm in the twelfth moment.</p>

<p>Chelsea's N'Golo Kante (left) in real life with Brighton and Hove Albion's Pascal Gross as they seek a header</p>

<p>Previous Chelsea full-back Tariq Lamptey was indeed a significant danger for Brighton on the right half of the assault</p>

<p>This was all making for an awkward watch for Tuchel following his side's lowering because of Manchester City on Saturday. Obviously, there's no embarrassment in losing 1-0 at the Etihad - yet the way of the misfortune would have upset Chelsea's German lead trainer.</p>

<p>His group's presentation here at the Amex will have done close to nothing to facilitate those concerns. However, some way or another the Blues ended up ahead at half-time.</p>

<p>Everybody in the Amex - Hakim Ziyech included - anticipated that Robert Sanchez should make what ought to have been a standard save when the Chelsea forward released a shot from 20 yards.</p>

<p>Without a doubt, the expression all over said everything as the ball mysteriously got away from Sanchez's outstretched arm prior to nestling inside the base right corner.</p>

<p>Brighton and Hove Albion's Neal Maupay leads with a high foot as he fights for ownership with Chelsea's Antonio Rudiger</p>

<p>Brighton supervisor Graham Potter guides Jakub Moder, as he watched his side fight to a very much acquired draw</p>

<p>Brighton perhaps didn't merit being ahead - however they absolutely merit being behind. You'd envision, nonetheless, that the Brighton manager is utilized to this at this point. There's no denying the Seagulls are among the most alluring groups to watch in England.</p>

<p>A group with a reasonable way of thinking, a group who face challenges, a group that engages. In any case, they are additionally a group that have for such a long time been innocuous where and when it makes a difference the most. Until Potter addresses the goalscoring problem, Brighton will forever be looking worryingly over their shoulders.</p>

<p>However, with all that said, Chelsea were obviously defenseless here. A warmed discussion among Ziyech and Romelu Lukaku as they strolled off for half-time surely wasn't demonstrative of a cheerful camp, in spite of Tuchel's endeavors to make light of the showdown after the game.</p>

<p>They were ahead, however this wasn't an exhibition that will persuade the club's allies that they will beat their colder time of year blip any time soon.</p>

<p>Romelu Lukaku indeed battled before objective, just having a single possibility during the 80 minutes he was on the pitch</p>

<p>The striker was subbed in the last 10 minutes similarly as Chelsea were hoping to get a genuinely necessary winning objective</p>

<p>The Blues are presently 12 focuses off Manchester City in the title race and could be dropping into the battle for the best four</p>

<p>So when Brighton scored the adjuster they so luxuriously merited on the hour mark, Tuchel might have had no bad things to say. Definitely, offered Brighton's trouble in cutting out chances from open play, their leveler showed up from a set-piece.</p>

<p>Having quite recently kept out Alexis Mac Allister's avoided exertion, Kepa Arrizabalaga got no opportunity when the Argentinian's resultant corner was going home by Adam Webster. Webster's association was valid - it went by Kepa like a shot.</p>

<p>The checking absolutely came up short; who at any point should get the Brighton place back had tragically neglected to do as such.</p>

<p>Not that Potter minded a scribble. At this point, Chelsea were on the ropes. Webster, who is certainly on Gareth Southgate's radar, was driving his group forward from safeguard, while Lamptey was causing Alonso all universes of issues until his replacement in the 76th moment.</p>

<p>Lukaku, who had been to a great extent mysterious separated from a 72nd moment chance that was very much saved by Sanchez, was snared off instead of Kai Havertz in the 80th moment - a fascinating sub-plot, maybe, given his new difficulties.</p>

<p>Yet, Brighton couldn't exactly observe the executioner blow. 'We're truly satisfied and pleased with the exhibition most certainly. We gave Chelsea a decent game. Our presentation was loaded with everything,' said Potter. Chelsea's presentation then again...</p>

<p>Have pundit</p>

<p>90min: Brighton clear a corner similar to Kovacic, however from 25 yards he ineffectively fires over the bar as four minutes are added on at the Amex.</p>

<p>86min: Brighton haven't exactly abandoned three focuses yet - they are positively enticed to take it as they submit bodies to break on the counter assault. Yet, Chelsea also haven't exaggerated their hand and have an adequate number of bodies at the back to see off the Seagull's assault.</p>
