        <p>Intrigued clubs be careful: Diego Costa is searching for another club following the end of his agreement at Brazilian outfit Atletico Mineiro.</p>

<p>The Spanish-Brazilian forward brings confusion and disaster wherever he goes, close by a skill for scoring objectives obviously.</p>

<p>His most recent vocation move has raised hypothesis with regards to whether he could make a re-visitation of the Premier League - the hunting ground where he baffled numerous and took every one of the features during a three-year stretch at Chelsea.</p>

<p>Yet again striker Diego Costa is presently a free specialist after his delivery from Atletico Mineiro</p>

<p>Costa (right) was known for disturbing up Premier League safeguards during his time at Chelsea</p>

<p>Late reports have even connected the 33-year-old forward to Arsenal, the club who detested him most during his time in England after he wrapped up their safeguards to an early shower and gotten numerous objectives past the Gunners goalkeepers.</p>

<p>With Costa plotting his best course of action in football, Sportsmail sees Costa's most attractive minutes in his vocation...</p>

<p>COSTA VS GARETH BARRY</p>

<p>Maybe Costa's most odd evening of football came during Chelsea's FA Cup quarter-last loss by Everton back in 2016, where the striker was shipped off for two unusual conflicts with Toffees midfielder Gareth Barry.</p>

<p>The two players began their fight in the principal half when Costa fundamentally bounced into the rear of Barry, with the Chelsea striker continuing to move around the floor as though he was the one fouled.</p>

<p>Costa was shipped off in Chelsea's 2016 FA Cup misfortune to Everton for conflicting with Gareth Barry</p>

<p>At the point when arbitrator Michael Oliver gave the free-kick to Everton, Costa was straight up off the ground after his vain behaviors and his oppositions acquired him a first reserving of the evening.</p>

<p>With Costa's Chelsea being disappointed in the final part when Romelu Lukaku got a support to place Everton in charge, Costa saw red - in a real sense. One more piece with Barry saw the forward attempt to head-butt the midfielder - and afterward seemed to endeavor a chomp on his neck.</p>

<p>Costa then, at that point, went to snuggle Barry yet those comforts couldn't get him out of a subsequent yellow. The Chelsea striker had an early shower and keeping in mind that Barry went along with him later on in the game for a critical foul, it was an occurrence which didn't look great on the Blues star.</p>

<p>The Chelsea striker seemed to nibble at Barry prior to acquiring his second yellow of the evening</p>

<p>Assuming THE WHOLE OF LIVERPOOL</p>

<p>Everton's Merseyside rivals Liverpool additionally got their reasonable part of Costa bedlam throughout the long term, with the 2015 League Cup semi-last seeing things bubble over between the Reds and the Chelsea striker.</p>

<p>The second leg at Stamford Bridge was finely ready after a 1-1 draw at Anfield however the Spanish-Brazilian striker attempted to menace his Blues side into the last.</p>

<p>Costa took Liverpool's players in the 2015 League Cup semi-last, including Steven Gerrard</p>

<p>Costa seemed to step on Emre Can by the touchline in his first contention of the evening</p>

<p>So, Costa attempted to take in the whole Liverpool group in a few harmful fights. Two of them came in the initial ten minutes, as he seemed to step on Emre Can approach the touchline prior to fouling skipper Steven Gerrard and exasperating him up by sitting on him for a couple of moments.</p>

<p>Once more in the last part, Costa seemed to strike again when he left somewhat a lot on Martin Skrtel following a 50:50 test, which didn't satisfy the Liverpool side.</p>

<p>This time, Costa's Chelsea wound up on top, as Branislav Ivanovic's extra-time header acquired the Blues an excursion to Wembley for the last, however not without a difficult situation.</p>

<p>Costa likewise seemed to blow up at Martin Skrtel after half-time in the thin home triumph</p>

<p>SCRAPS WITH SERGIO</p>

<p>While at Atletico Madrid, Costa delighted in fighting Real protectors in the city derby. Skipper Sergio Ramos was his primary objective, with the striker focusing on him not once, however two times!</p>

<p>The principal significant fight among Ramos and Costa came in December 2012, when the pair were involved in a skirmish of spit.</p>

<p>At the point when the two players settled, Costa attempted to heabutt Ramos, who then, at that point, seemed to spit at the Atleti striker first, yet the previous took it excessively far after that.</p>

<p>Costa (left) conflicted with Sergio Ramos (center) in two Madrid derbies at Spanish side Atletico</p>

<p>Away from the official's view, the forward seemed to stack his hand up with spit prior to tossing his hand toward the Real community back.</p>

<p>Ramos had the last snicker, nonetheless, as his Real side won that Madrid derby 2-0 on account of objectives from Cristiano Ronaldo and Mesut Ozil - however it wasn't long until those two conflicted once more.</p>

<p>The 2018 Super Cup saw Ramos and Costa clash once more, with the Atleti striker obviously kicking the Real safeguard in the head during a tussle. This time, Costa wound up on the triumphant side, with his support helping Atleti to a 4-2 triumph in Estonia.</p>

<p>COSTA VS GABRIEL PAULISTA</p>

<p>Armory fans detested seeing Diego Costa - and they had valid justification to.</p>

<p>The Spanish-Brazilian scored four objectives in seven matches against Arsene Wenger's Gunners, which contained the champ in the 2018 Europa League semi-last in Atleti tones, objectives in two Premier League triumphs for Chelsea and a strike in the 2017 FA Cup last.</p>

<p>Costa (center) was the hero in getting Arsenal's Gabriel Paulista shipped off in 2015</p>

<p>However, it was his September 2015 conflict with Brazilian protector Gabriel Paulista which sent Arsenal fans to the brink as far as their contempt for Costa.</p>

<p>With a nearby game locked at 0-0 towards the finish of the principal half, Costa seemed to swipe Arsenal protector Laurent Koscielny in the face while trying for an airborne duel. Koscielny responded out of frustration and was jumped over by Costa, which brought over Gunners protector Gabriel.</p>

<p>The Brazilian community back faced Costa - with the two players acquiring themselves a booking. The Chelsea striker, nonetheless, continued to offend Gabriel in the seconds that followed - and the Arsenal man in the long run snapped.</p>

<p>Gabriel attempted to guilefully kick out at Costa in the following period of play yet official Mike Dean spotted it. The Gunners safeguard was shipped off by Dean and Chelsea proceeded to dominate the match 2-0 in the final part.</p>

<p>Costa (right) had prior conflicted with Laurent Koscielny (left) which wrapped Gabriel up</p>

<p>GETTING SENT OFF... IN PRE-SEASON</p>

<p>Diego Costa doesn't do pre-season. Particularly when you place a Madrid derby in the early season plan.</p>

<p>Genuine and Atleti were drawn together in the 2019 International Champions Cup and their New Jersey confrontation unquestionably didn't baffle.</p>

<p>A strange 7-3 success for Atleti saw Costa score multiple times in a short time, prior to being shipped off soon after the hour mark.</p>

<p>Costa's (center) conflict with Real Madrid's Dani Carvajal (left) acquired him a pre-season red card</p>

<p>The conflict in the 2019 International Champions Cup ignited an all-powerful New Jersey fight</p>

<p>The Spanish-Brazilian striker was not content with his fourfold aiding of objectives, he simply expected to scrap someone. At the point when Real safeguard Dani Carvajal swiped at his Atleti partner Thomas Lemar, that was the straw that broke the camel's back.</p>

<p>Costa then, at that point, took out Carvajal with a broad kick and a mass fight followed. Both Carvajal and Costa were shipped off for their particular jobs in the piece, in one of the more critical pre-season experiences as of late.</p>

<p>COSTA VS SHAWCROSS</p>

<p>Life didn't dependably go Diego Costa's way and one swelling excursion to Stoke City in November 2015 showed what can happen when the previous Chelsea forward didn't get what he needed.</p>

<p>Costa's Chelsea were beaten 1-0 at the home of the Potters, with the forward partaking in a tussle with Stoke safeguard Ryan Shawcross all through the game.</p>

<p>Costa (center) designated Stoke safeguard Ryan Shawcross (directly) in Chelsea's 1-0 association misfortune</p>

<p>Elbows were flying in the early times of the game, yet it was one diverting arrangement of corresponds in the final part which commanded the notice.</p>

<p>Costa took on Shawcross with a drive forward in the Stoke half prior to going to ground too effectively under the protector's tackle. Costa got up, disappointed at the absence of a free-kick, prior to signaling to Shawcross that his stench was not however he would prefer.</p>

<p>Shawcross' Stoke ran out victors come the finish of the game however 'StinkGate' was a long way from being done. The protector's significant other, Kath, uncovered via web-based media that she had advised her better half to put on antiperspirant that evening, while Shawcross was given a year of body splash by BBC Radio Stoke.</p>

<p>At the point when Costa was focusing on me and not the game, then, at that point, the fight was won,' Shawcross said at that point. 'He is a top player and I was satisfied to keep him calm.'</p>

<p>Costa attempted to wrap up Shawcross by training in on his personal stench in the wake of bluffing injury</p>

<p> POST-TITLE CELEBRATIONS</p>

<p>Costa's last ventures as a Chelsea player was to convey the 2016-17 title to Stamford Bridge in their first season under Antonio Conte.</p>

<p>The Blues took care of business with a 1-0 triumph away at West Bromwich Albion in May 2017, with Costa's 20 Premier League objectives the fundamental impetus for the title showing up in west London that season.</p>

<p>However it was his post-title festivities at the Hawthorns that snatched the features, with Costa going beserk in the Chelsea changing area.</p>

<p>The striker was found crushing on one individual from the Chelsea' private cabin staff and when he was doused in a wide range of fluid in the evolving room, he was seen drying his eyes out with, er, Lucozade Sport.</p>

<p>Costa then, at that point, crashed Conte's question and answer session and asked the media to end the discussion as he was frantic to return to west London. At the point when the Italian chief was called to perform more media responsibilities, he took steps to let a fire douser off by balancing it over the tops of the columnists addressing Conte in a cluster.</p>

<p>Frantic, hyper and hypnotizing - that is Diego Costa more or less.</p>
