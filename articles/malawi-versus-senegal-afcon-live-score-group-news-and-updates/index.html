        <p>Heavyweights Senegal neglected to fire again and were lucky not to yield a punishment in a 0-0 draw with unfancied Malawi.</p>

<p>The Lions of Teranga actually completed in best position in Group B at the Africa Cup of Nations.</p>

<p>Senegal won the gathering with five places, regardless of scoring just a single time in their three matches by means of a late Sadio Mane punishment against Zimbabwe in their initial game.</p>

<p>It was a full-blooded challenge among Malawi and Senegal in the last gathering stage game</p>

<p>Chelsea's Edouard Mendy had some work to do as the minnows nearly sprung an amazement</p>

<p>The Senegal fans in the stands put on a more amazing showcase than their side</p>

<p>Malawi and Guinea both wrapped up with four focuses yet the last option required second spot on the no holds barred rule.</p>

<p>The Malawians should now hold back to check whether they are one of the four best third-put groups, who additionally advance to the following round.</p>

<p>Malawi were left seething when Cameroon official Blaise Ngwa at first granted them a late punishment at the Kouekong Stadium in Bafoussam.</p>

<p>Gomezgani Chirwa was brought down in the container by safeguard Bouna Sarr.</p>

<p>In any case, the choice was upset on survey, however Senegal can view themselves however lucky as there might have been both a draw of the shirt and contact.</p>

<p>Kalidou Koulibaly (left) began yet the Napoli man looked diminutive of match wellness</p>

<p>It was a serious undertaking yet Senegal are still truly to find their sweet spot in the opposition</p>

<p>Peruse Sportsmail's live blog to perceive how the activity unfurled.</p>

<p>Have pundit</p>

<p>Have analyst</p>

<p>Malawi punched well over their weight there. In excess of 100 groups separate the two in the FIFA rankings however it looked far nearer than that. A VAR actually take a look at denied them a punishment in what ended up being the greatest second in the game however this drag attract has been to the point of owning Senegal.</p>

<p>Malawi should hold on to check whether they can go through as one of the most outstanding third spot groups. Senegal are edging towards capability on top of the gathering without having played especially well once more.</p>

<p>87 mins: The previous Bristol City man chests it down, turns and volleys yet Thom is fortunate the shot is straight down his throat. He's battling with a physical issue yet needs to see this one out for his side.</p>

<p>83 mins: Malawi are pressing the back with players and keeping the spaces little, making it hard for Senegal, who miss the mark on truly inventive player. The corner circles long and past any of Sarr's partners, permitting the minnows to crush it clear.</p>

<p>Would Senegal be able to observe a late champ as they did against Zimbabwe in the opener?</p>

<p>It was anything but a plunge however it was really delicate that the arbitrator has chosen to upset it. The hand was on the shoulder of the Malawi player yet he went down without any problem. The Malawi players are destroyed with that choice.</p>

<p>A flooding assault down the left for Malawi. There's not an enormous measure of contact and the arbitrator will really look at this one, or rather his VAR group will. Presently he's being told to examine the screen.</p>

<p>71 mins: Just when it looked like Senegal had the proportion of this group, Malawi send off their very own few attacks to sting them to their faculties. Pape Gueye and Diehiou are into the activity for Senegal.</p>

<p>Malawi need new legs in the event that they will hold around here - Senegal have influenced the energy and exhaustion could very much come into it as sunset falls in Cameroon.</p>

<p>Naby Keita has pulled one back for Guinea to set up a thrilling last thirty minutes.</p>

<p>60 mins: The Malawi manager, Thom, is embraced by his partners in the wake of tipping over a wide freekick from Gueye. The protection is becoming extended now and it seems like an objective could be coming. Dieng is coming on for Diallo in the principal change of the game</p>

<p>56 mins: You can't blame the longing of this Malawi group, they miss the mark on wealth of specialized expertise yet are constant in their running thus far have kept this gifted Senegal side under control. All things considered, the way things are they're going through.</p>

<p>54 mins: Set pieces are known to be the Achilles heel for this Malawi group at the two closures of the pitch. They go for a speculative shot from an intense point in assault and afterward surrender a free header to Diallo, who can't exploit and powers his work above and beyond.</p>

<p>50 mins: Brilliant reflexes from the Malawi guardian to spill a Diallo header. He folds at the resulting corner yet they scramble it away. There's better direness about Senegal, there couldn't have been any less to be reasonable.</p>

<p>Koulibaly, Gueye and Mane need to show others how its done. Gueye has been chopped down in an awkward test and is being treated on the pitch for what resembles a calf injury.</p>

<p>Not by and large a vintage half of football. Malawi are accomplishing something beyond disappointing Senegal and have been the better side. Zimbabwe are ahead against Guinea so the Lions of Taranga can relax... for the time being.</p>

<p>Senegal have scarcely had a sniff, simply that Mane possibility. They won't go far in this competition playing like this. It has been a trudge and despite the fact that they're as yet on course to qualify, this has been poor.</p>

<p>38 mins: The Napoli community back needs two or three games to arrive at full match wellness and Mhango nearly makes him look exceptionally absurd, hooking onto a through ball however bungling the opportunity to wrap up. Then, at that point, Mendy is constrained into another save, Malawi are well on top!</p>

<p>36 mins: The example of this challenge is undeniably more even than you'd have envisioned, Malawi are courageous enough ready to not just acknowledge their adversaries overwhelming. Senegal need a touch of sorcery or a strategic shift here.</p>

<p>32 mins: A free kick in a hazardous position has Mendy scrambling to keep it out and the Malawi players appeal for handball, not given and very right as well yet it didn't stop the manager Ronny Van Geneugden joining the allure behind schedule.</p>

<p>This one is a shock... also it implies Senegal are in best position for the time being.</p>

<p>They've gone from Dakar and all around Senegal to help their group and the fans are giving a rambunctious setting, presently they need the group to match their result.</p>

<p>27 mins: The PSG midfielder endeavors to drop one on Diallo's toe preposterous and it appeared to be a wonderful drifted ball yet ran out of play, they're back in the domination without making anything obvious.</p>

<p>22 mins: Senegal need to shock into life, they look half sleeping however marshal one more fair raid down the right. There are two men in the case however the cross can track down the goalkeeper, helpless conveyance.</p>

<p>17 mins: Great exertion from the Malawi striker, he interfaces well with his left foot and Mendy is at full stretch, assuaged to see the strike lift a few feet over the bar.</p>

<p>14 mins: This game has been even following 14 minutes, which isn't the manner in which it should look on the off chance that you're a Senegal fan. They have a lot of value through the spine of the group yet are looking battered with lost passes and no genuine cognizance about the manner in which they play.</p>

<p>He's needed game time obviously yet the Chelsea attendant just fluttered wildy at a high, balancing ball into the crate, simply figuring out how to clench hand it away from risk, not his tidiest work.</p>

<p>8 mins: Mane in full certainty and structure would opening this. Sarr marauds  down the flank and scales a ball back along the ground into the container. Malawi's safeguards can't respond on schedule and Mane takes in, endeavoring to dink it into the top corner yet the ball drifts simply wide. As yet standing by to score their first objective from open play in this competition and that was nearly it.</p>

<p>4 mins: The Liverpool flyer has played through the center up until this point yet is presently out on his inclined toward left flank. Senegal have siphoned several long reach balls super toward him as of now, which could well be a strategic ploy.</p>

<p>10 seconds: You never normally compose an update 10 seconds in yet Senegal go long from the start up and Mane grabs at a large portion of a possibility over the top, diverted out for a corner that fails miserably. An assertion of plan.</p>

<p>Tipped as victors, Senegal have complimented to misdirect in their initial two games and will consider today to be a day to light their mission in front of the knockout stages. The tension is in Cisse's group, Malawi are efficient yet you need to think quality will have the Lions of Teranga smacking them to the side. The players are out onto the pitch, start off surprisingly fast.</p>

<p>The Senegal fans are giving the commotion in the Kouekong Stadium in Bafoussam...</p>

<p>It's been a moderately sluggish beginning to the Africa Cup of Nations for Senegal, who have been to a great extent disappointed in their initial two games.</p>

<p>The Lions of Teranga required a 97-minute punishment from Sadio Mane to move beyond Zimbabwe in their initial game, while they were vigorously baffled in their 0-0 attract to Naby Keita's Guinea.</p>

<p>Malawi, in the interim, were beaten 1-0 by Guinea before Gabadinho Mhango, who plays for South African side Orlando Pirates, scored either side of half-time in their rebound prevail upon Zimbabwe.</p>

<p>The two sides will be hoping to get a knockout round spot yet need a positive outcome to accomplish it, or be left perspiring regarding how different groups in third-place admission.</p>

<p>There are three changes to the Malawi side from the side who won 2-1 against Zimbabwe in their last game.</p>

<p>Goalkeeper Charles Thomu replaces Ernest Kakhobwe between the sticks, while Limbikani Mzava is supplanted by Lawrence Chaziya at the back. Further forward, Mician Mhone is picked in front of striker Richard Mbulu.</p>

<p>Individual forward Gabadinho Mhango, the two-objective saint from the 2-1 win over Zimbabwe, gets another beginning.</p>

<p>The group news from the Senegal camp is great as Chelsea goalkeeper Edouard Mendy and Napoli's Kalidou Koulibaly make their initial beginnings of this AFCON competition.</p>

<p>The two players tried positive for Covid before the competition so were controlled out of the initial two games. The guarded pair start close by Liverpool's Sadio Mane, Crystal Palace's Cheikhou Kouyate and PSG's Idrissa Gueye in a solid line-up.</p>
