        <p>Everton are working to a four man waitlist as they plan to enlist a chief who can save their season.</p>

<p>Rafael Benitez was sacked over the course of the end of the week, after a grim loss at Norwich left them only six focuses over the assignment zone.</p>

<p>Presently the Everton board are searching for one more new director before they slide much further down the table.</p>

<p>Wayne Rooney (left) is available to a shock return to Everton after he and previous England colleague Frank Lampard (right) arose as competitors to supplant Rafa Benitez</p>

<p>Roberto Martinez, the current administrator of the Belgian group, has been connected with a return</p>

<p>Previous Bayern Munich and Monaco mentor Niko Kovac is one more on the Everton waitlist</p>

<p>Duncan Ferguson has taken guardian charge as he moved in 2019 with Wayne Rooney, Frank Lampard, Niko Kovac and Roberto Martinez the chief names in the casing to be the following super durable director.</p>

<p>However, how do this group of four have the right stuff? Sportsmail surveys them in a few critical regions as the Toffees hope to settle on the best decision.</p>

<p>Chief LEAGUE EXPERIENCE</p>

<p>Rooney - As a trough, none. Rooney's solitary occupation in a youngster administrative profession has seen him assume responsibility for 65 games at Championship strugglers Derby County.</p>

<p>So the Premier League would be a totally different situation for the previous England chief in such manner.</p>

<p>However, consider Rooney's playing profession and his Premier League experience is huge. 98 first class games for Everton and 393 for Manchester United, with 25 and 183 objectives separately.</p>

<p>As far as what is needed to make due and flourish in the Premier League, Rooney surely wouldn't be under any deceptions. 6/10</p>

<p>Wayne Rooney's first taste of the executives at Derby County has been a rite of passage yet the previous England commander savors the test</p>

<p>Lampard - The previous England midfielder has some insight of overseeing in the Premier League from his season-and-a-half in control at Chelsea. Of 57 association matches he assumed responsibility for, he won 28, drew 11 and lost 18.</p>

<p>While his first season at Stamford Bridge was fair enough as they took fourth spot, things disentangled rapidly in his second regardless of large crew speculation.</p>

<p>Chelsea were 10th, having won just two times in eight association matches, when Lampard was terminated in January 2021. He has since been connected with high level positions, for example, Norwich back in November and Crystal Palace the previous summer, however he hasn't gotten back to the uncovered.</p>

<p>There's additionally his broad Premier League insight with West Ham, Chelsea and Manchester City. 609 games altogether, the third-most noteworthy ever in the opposition. 7/10</p>

<p>Lamprd has been connected to the Crystal Palace and Norwich occupations since his Chelsea terminating</p>

<p>Kovac - No Premier League experience either as a player or a chief. Kovac's playing days were spent transcendently in Germany and the Croatian has since instructed in Croatia, Germany and France. His latest occupation was a season-and-a-half with Monaco in Ligue 1.</p>

<p>So his main openness to the English game comes from a small bunch of European ties however he scored for Croatia against England at Euro 2004. 1/10</p>

<p>Martinez - The Spaniard has significantly more experience of overseeing in the Premier League than the other three. He has assumed responsibility for 265 games in the division when at Wigan Athletic somewhere in the range of 2009 and 2013 and during his first stretch as Everton chief (2013-2016).</p>

<p>When at Wigan, he directed them to completions of sixteenth, sixteenth, fifteenth lastly eighteenth with that last season seeing them accomplish the uncommon twofold of transfer and a FA Cup win.</p>

<p>Beforehand at Goodison Park, he drove Everton to a great fifth situation in his first season and eleventh in the second. They were twelfth in his third mission when he was sacked with one match of the period remaining.</p>

<p>So his administrative involvement with the Premier League surely overshadows the other three applicants - and by some distance. 9/10</p>

<p>Roberto Martinez was Everton chief somewhere in the range of 2013 and 2016 with differed achievement</p>

<p>Prize CABINET</p>

<p>Rooney - Nothing yet in administration, with Derby working at some unacceptable finish of the Championship during Rooney's first season, making due just barely on the last day.</p>

<p>This season has been much more dreadful, with the club's very presence under danger and a 21-point derivation for entering organization and breaking EFL monetary principles.</p>

<p>So prizes are far from Rooney's psyche right now. As a player, be that as it may, he was a chronic champ and having played under the amazing Sir Alex Ferguson, he knows the stuff to win standard flatware.</p>

<p>Five Premier League titles, a FA Cup, three League Cups, the Champions League, Europa League and a Club World Cup were the prizes for a shining playing profession. 6/10</p>

<p>Rooney won essentially all that there is to win as a player at Manchester United</p>

<p>Lampard - Trophies have up until this point sidestepped Lampard in administration however there have been a few near fiascoes. He took Derby to the Championship Play-off last in 2019, just to lose 2-1 to Aston Villa at Wembley.</p>

<p>What's more he got back to Wembley with Chelsea in the 2020 FA Cup last, losing to Arsenal.</p>

<p>Like Rooney, Lampard knew about the flavor of accomplishment during a tremendously effective playing profession. He won three Premier League titles, four FA Cups, two League Cups, the Champions League and the Europa League at Chelsea.</p>

<p>So he also realizes what is needed from a group to win prizes. 7/10</p>

<p>Lampard arrived at Wembley with Chelsea however they lost to Arsenal in the 2020 FA Cup last</p>

<p>Kovac - The Croatian has a few prizes from his administrative vocation. His Eintracht Frankfurt side beat Bayern Munich to win the German Cup in 2018.</p>

<p>Indeed, even before that, Bayern had picked Kovac as their next supervisor. His time in control there wasn't extraordinary yet they actually won the Bundesliga title and the German Cup Double, which truly has turned into the base expected of a Bayern mentor.</p>

<p>He directed Monaco to the French Cup last season too, however they lost 2-0 to Paris Saint-Germain. So Kovac is a man with fresher information on arriving at finals and winning things as Everton fantasy about finishing a prize dry season tracing all the way back to 1995. 9/10</p>

<p>Niko Kovac directed Bayern Munich to a Bundesliga and German Cup Double during 2018-19</p>

<p>Martinez - There have been victories for Martinez the administrator. He won advancement into the Championship with Swansea in 2008 and drove Wigan to an implausible FA Cup last win over Manchester City in 2013.</p>

<p>Be that as it may, he didn't take Everton any nearer to flatware the initial time around and he has been reprimanded for not winning anything with Belgium's 'Brilliant Generation' during his most recent posting.</p>

<p>They completed third at the 2018 World Cup in Russia, having lost to France in the semi-finals, and lost to Italy in the quarter-finals of Euro 2020.</p>

<p>So some achievement yet a brief period back at this point. 7/10</p>

<p>Roberto Martinez significantly drove Wigan Athletic to FA Cup greatness by beating Man City in 2013</p>

<p>Accessibility</p>

<p>Rooney - In work at Derby County however the eventual fate of the club is so dubious right now, who can say for sure how much longer that will endure.</p>

<p>With the EFL requesting confirmations that Derby's executives have the assets expected to see out the rest of the period, the danger of the club being exchanged weaving machines speculation and new proprietorship comes in fast.</p>

<p>While Rooney has over and again focused on his obligation to Derby regardless of how miserable the reason, no one would truly resent him a break course to a previous club.</p>

<p>Given Derby's parlous monetary circumstance, any remuneration for a chief whose agreement lapses one year from now could be a welcome lift. 6/10</p>

<p>Notwithstanding a 21-point derivation, Derby moved off the lower part of the table at the end of the week</p>

<p>Lampard - Out of work since his terminating by Chelsea on January 25 last year. Lampard has been connected with different opportunities yet hasn't viewed as the right fit.</p>

<p>Accepting he is keen on taking the occupation on, would be accessible to begin work straight away which is alluring for Everton in the midst of a bustling timetable in association and cup. 10/10</p>

<p>Kovac - Sacked by Monaco toward the beginning of this current month following year and a half in control notwithstanding the group being admirably inside contacting distance of the Champions League places in Ligue 1.</p>

<p>Reports recommended that Kovac had lost a power battle with the French club's wearing chief Paul Mitchell rather than being terminated on account of results on the field.</p>

<p>All things considered, they had additionally made it into the knockout phases of the UEFA Europa League. He may not wish to get back to the executives unexpectedly early and would require a work license yet is generally free. 9/10</p>

<p>Kovac was terminated soon after the New Year following a power battle in the background</p>

<p>Martinez - It would be muddled and costly for Everton to completely extricate Martinez from his occupation with the Belgian public side, particularly in a World Cup year.</p>

<p>He is contracted until after the competition wraps up in December and the Belgian FA are hesitant to allow him to try and occupation share for the rest of the period.</p>

<p>That is regardless of Belgium having a generally light responsibility of two March amicable matches among now and the finish of the club season.</p>

<p>Of the group of four, getting Martinez would obviously be the most troublesome, even on a transitory plan. 3/10</p>

<p>Martinez's Belgium missed the mark at a significant competition again when they lost to Italy in the quarter-finals of Euro 2020 last year</p>

<p>WOULD THE FANS WANT HIM?</p>

<p>Rooney - The help for a Goodison return for Rooney has all the earmarks of being really tepid. There is affirmation for the phenomenal work he is doing under troublesome conditions at Derby yet no widespread intensity for his arrangement.</p>

<p>Many Everton fans via web-based media bring up that he can't actually lose right now given the frightful situation at Derby as isn't under the sort of tension he'd look at Goodison.</p>
