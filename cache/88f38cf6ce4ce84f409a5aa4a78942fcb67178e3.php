<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Colin Montgomerie fears the 150th Open at St Andrews in July will be the keep going to be organized on the noteworthy Old Course. The Scot's pride is blended in with tension that the Home of Golf will be scoured by the game's power hitters, drove by Bryson DeChambeau.</p>

<p>'Would you be able to envision what will occur assuming that the climate is great and there's little wind?' said the 58-year-old, showing up at the Abu Dhabi HSBC Championship this week and being as candid as could be expected.</p>

<p>'It scarcely bears contemplating. Bryson will stand up there and think six or seven openings on the course are driveable. The standard five fifth will be a joke, with a flick of a wedge for his subsequent shot.</p>

<p>Colin Montgomerie fears the 150th Open at St Andrews will be the keep going one on the course</p>

<p>'Concerning the standard four eighteenth, recollect all the energy once upon a time when Jack Nicklaus turned into the primary man to drive the green? They were hitting it with three woods back when I completed second to Tiger in 2005 and this year they will hit it with irons. That would be truly pitiful assuming that occurs.'</p>

<p>Montgomerie's words reverberation those of Greg Norman before the last Open at Royal St George's.</p>

<p>'St Andrews is my cherished seminar on the rota and it would be appalling to see it become obsolete yet that is at risk for being the truth,' the Australian told Sportsmail. 'I can't understand how they might extend it any more.'</p>

<p>The Scot's pride is blended in with nervousness that the Home of Golf will be scoured by power hitters</p>

<p>Any semblance of large hitter Bryson DeChambeau (above) is known for his capacity to drive the ball</p>

<p>Norman, as so many, called for something to be finished in regards to how far the ball ventures. The R&amp;A, related to the American administering body the USGA, have given commendable explanations of aim flagging their arrangement that something should be finished. Hitherto, in any case, they've met wild obstruction from other invested individuals.</p>

<p>Montgomerie accepts this Open could be the one that presents to everything to a head.</p>

<p>'Contemplate the main opening, where the consume before the green is 340 yards from the tee,' he said. 'For Bryson, that is possible. Envision him taking that on and driving the green? That would be the end. There'd be no chance back from that.'</p>

<p>In the interim, Tommy Fleetwood feels fit, new and prepared to move up the rankings subsequent to tumbling to a modest 41st on the planet in the wake of being hit with Covid at the back finish of 2021.</p>

<p>'You realize you're prepared for a break when you've been at home for a very long time and not contemplated getting a club once, yet it's astonishing once the new year comes around,' he said. 'Something snaps and you're prepared and inspired once more.'</p>

<p>Greg Norman says St Andrews is his top choice and that he will be dismal on the off chance that 'it becomes obsolete'</p>

<p>First up in a three-week Middle East stretch is the Abu Dhabi HSBC Championship, an occasion he won in 2017 and 2018. A possibility, hence, to say something?</p>

<p>'I most certainly need to kick on quickly however it's not just with regards to winning,' he said. 'I went two years after my triumph here in 2018 without winning again however I played extraordinary and had an exceptionally cheerful outlook on where my game was at on the grounds that I was doing the right things.</p>

<p>'My iron play was in reality generally excellent last year yet there's just such a lot of you can do in the event that you're not on the fairway frequently enough. That was the greatest dissatisfaction since driving is dependably my greatest wellspring of certainty. At the point when you're remaining on the tee and feeling a piece uncertain, it's hard to challenge the folks who are playing great.</p>

<p>'I got more predictable towards the end and ideally that was me putting down a base so I can begin testing once more.'</p>
