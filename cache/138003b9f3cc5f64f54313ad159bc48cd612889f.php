<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A transport path that is just 39ft long and 'should be the littlest in London' has created more than £440,000 in fines in just shy of two years.</p>

<p>Ongoing figures showed 7,854 drivers were found driving on the little segment of Northolt Road at the intersection with Alexandra Avenue, in South Harrow, between April 2019 and the finish of 2021.</p>

<p>The figures were gotten by Geoffrey Ben-Nathan, 77, a driver who submitted an opportunity of data (FOI) solicitation to Harrow Council after he figured out how to upset his own fine on that stretch of the street.</p>

<p>Altogether, the chamber, who said the bus station is set up 'as per the law', generated £442,363.36 in the 21-month time frame.</p>

<p>A 39ft transport path in Northolt Road, South Harrow, created £442,363.36 in fines in the wake of getting 7,854 drivers between April 2019 and the finish of December 2021</p>

<p>The figures were acquired by Geoffrey Ben-Nathan (imagined), 77, a driver who presented an opportunity of data (FOI) solicitation to Harrow Council after he figured out how to topple his own fine on that stretch of the street</p>

<p>Mr Ben-Nathan was fined in the wake of crashing into the 39ft (12-meter) part of the transport path which has an every minute of every day limitation.</p>

<p>The granddad who has said the stretch of street 'should be the littlest transport path in London,' contended the guidelines were 'muddled' as the remainder of the limitations along a similar course just applied at specific times.</p>

<p>He approached the committee to either eliminate the segment of 24 hour limitations or to carry out signs making it more clear to different drivers in the wake of guaranteeing there is 'no prescriptive admonition sign guiding the driver to move to another lane'.</p>

<p>Harrow Council questioned his view, in any case, saying 'we trust that the signage here is clear'.</p>

<p>The case was taken to a council where adjudicators controlled in support of himself, after Mr Ben-Nathan, who himself estimated the little stretch of the transport path, gave different instances of drivers being gotten out driving on the little segment of street.</p>

<p>He guaranteed the committee was glad to keep the transport path set up and even to lose a couple of cases as they probably were aware a great many people would 'basically settle up'.</p>

<p>He said measures ought to be set up to make the circumstance more clear to drivers, especially in a space he portrayed just like a 'issue spot', and required all committees to be put under a 'legal obligation to hail up the entirety of negations' which are seen happening more regularly than normal.</p>

<p>Mr Ben-Nathan, who was fined in the wake of crashing into the 39ft (12-meter) segment of the transport path which has an all day, every day limitation, contended the principles were 'muddled'</p>

<p>Mr Ben-Nathan additionally addressed what reason the transport path serves, calling it 'a crate along one side of a little three-sided island'.</p>

<p>In January 2020, the gathering was addressed on a comparative issue on a similar stretch of street.</p>

<p>On that event, a gathering representative said: 'The law is clear - you can't drive in a transport path anytime where there is a strong white line.</p>

<p>'We remain by our view that the signage is substantial and clear as indicated by the law.'</p>
