<p>'So on the off chance that I can't play at the most significant level, I rather keep away from superfluous analysis on the off chance that I don't sufficiently run or can't score similar measure of objectives as I did in Europe.</p>

<p>'So I need to play some place I am glad and agreeable. Likewise I need to play in an association where I can in any case perform and continue appreciating playing soccer.</p>

<p>'So I don't figure I will get back to South America, however the United States or Asia are excellent choices when I turn 37.'</p>
