<p>'The [Paul] battle with Mike Tyson, there's a decent possibility that will not get authorized either,' the ex-MMA star said on his YouTube channel.</p>

<p>'At the point when Mike Tyson returned and battled Roy Jones Jr, I accept that was in Florida since they couldn't get authorized in Las Vegas.</p>

<p>'Las Vegas is the battle capital of the world, the Nevada State Athletic Commissions that is one of the hardest to get authorized by.</p>

<p>Also the ex-UFC champion accepts a possible show against Paul will bring comparable issues</p>

<p>'Is it going to occur? As per Mike Tyson, the solution to that is no. I might want to see [Paul] battle Tommy Fury, comparable size, age and experience.'</p>

<p>'I resembled "goodness, fascinating", yet as a matter of first importance not that intriguing in light of the fact that it fits the equation, doesn't it,' he proceeded.</p>

<p>'Well it doesn't completely fit the equation since it's a fighter, for one's purposes, and I'm not being a f****** skeptic yet he's yet to battle a fighter, however this is a fighter so that is somewhat surprising.</p>

<p>'In the more regular, it's a person who's right around 60 years of age. I'm not affronting "Iron" Mike Tyson, never in a world would I do that. The man is really an incredible fighter,</p>

<p>'Be that as it may, he is right around 60 years of age and I consider in light of the fact that what occurred in Jake Paul's last battle he sorts of necessities someone like a Mike Tyson.'</p>
