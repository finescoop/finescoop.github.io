<p>Francis Ngannou strutted his belt around Cameroon and is frantic to battle in Africa</p>

<p>The UFC heavyweight champion is taking on Ciryl Gane next Saturday at UFC 270</p>

<p>Imagined with his mom, Ngannou talked with regards to what it would intend to battle in his country</p>

<p>Maybe it is nothing unexpected that a man who got away from the salt mines of Cameroon to arrive at Europe on a dinghy and changed himself from destitute in Paris to turning into a worldwide star - has his look on another skyline.</p>

<p>He marks himself and Nigerian-conceived champions Israel Adesanya and Kamaru Usman the 'Three Kings' of the UFC and told Sportsmail of his craving for every one of the three African stars to include on a card on the landmass.</p>

<p>'It is a major dream. Exceptionally difficult to occur now yet you know, with time we'll sort out a method for getting it going, to battle for our kin,' he said.</p>

<p>Ngannou won the belt last year when he took out Stipe Miocic in the first round</p>

<p>Ngannou let Sportsmail know no difference in mindset from is being the tracker to chased</p>

<p>Ngannou needs to battle close by Kamaru Usman (right) and Israel Adesanya (left)</p>

<p>The pair have been going this way and that via web-based media and Ngannou has demanded that any new UFC contract he signs should permit him to box as an afterthought.</p>

<p>He recommended Fury should battle him with MMA rules wearing enclosing gloves the enclosure.</p>

<p>At the point when asked how the 'Wanderer King' would passage in those conditions, Ngannou construed: 'Tyson Fury can keep going extremely long, he has substantiated himself he can keep going seemingly forever.</p>

<p>'I don't have the foggiest idea how long he would endure however without a doubt I would toss a few bombs at him!'</p>

<p>Be that as it may, contemplations of Fury and a notable occasion in his homeland should be retired for the present. Ngannou enters UFC 270 as the wagering dark horse and realizes he is confronting one of the most interesting gifts at heavyweight for quite a while.</p>

<p>Gane moves like a middleweight in a heavyweight's body and Ngannou no longer has the consuming yearning to win his first title, having accomplished his objective last year in the deposing of Stipe Miocic.</p>

<p>Ngannou heads into his first UFC heavyweight title guard as the bookies' longshot</p>

<p>Yet, the 35-year-old demands the way that the tracker is currently the pursued doesn't change his methodology heading into next Saturday night.</p>

<p>'It doesn't change my attitude definitely, yes I am the hero yet when I take a gander at a battle, I couldn't care less about being a boss,' he contemplated.</p>

<p>'I simply care about being a superior contender and that has been my objective for quite a while, my way to deal with the battle.</p>

<p>'I go to the battle to be the prevailing one, not checking out the title or whatever it is. Toward the day's end, without the belt you're as yet another warrior, assuming there is a lopsidedness in that, you will commit an error some place.'</p>

<p>Furthermore he likewise gives little assurance to the brief timeframe the pair went through fighting together three years prior, demanding much has changed since they shared the mat in the Paris exercise center.</p>

<p>The hero demands he isn't really acquainted with Ciryl Gane in spite of their fighting</p>

<p>'I'm not intimately acquainted with Ciryl Gane, I prepared with him for around three weeks and I don't think this is to the point of saying you know about somebody', Ngannou demanded.</p>

<p>'This was likewise three years prior, everybody has improved and dealt with various stuff so it makes no difference for me.'</p>

<p>It will be entrancing to see whether Ngannou can take care of the youthful, hungry challenger. Assuming he fizzles, that belt and that multitude of large dreams will slip from his grip.</p>
