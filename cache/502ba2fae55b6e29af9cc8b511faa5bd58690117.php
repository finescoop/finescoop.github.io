<p>Yet, previous striker Shearer said Hudson-Odoi needed energy and that Tuchel should now capture their concern slide, while individual ex-forward Wright was left astounded at one piece of play which saw the 21-year-old kill the force in a promising assault by passing the ball as far as possible back to the protection.</p>

<p>'Hudson-Odoi I thought he had a truly helpless game this evening,' Shearer told Premier League Productions.</p>

<p>'You're searching for some, energy, you're searching for an eruption of speed to go past the safeguard and it won't ever occur.</p>

<p>'It's his [Tuchel's] task to figure it out in light of the fact that we can see it occurring on the pitch, we saw it on Saturday against Manchester City, we saw it again against Brighton, it's anything but a glad camp and that is one reason, for sure.'</p>

<p>In the interim, referring to the occurrence in the final part which saw Hudson-Odoi pass the ball as far as possible back to the protection, Wright said: 'This was an ideal open door. Check out [Romelu] Lukaku, you see his arms up in he air.</p>

<p>'Hudson-Odoi in that occurrence, he has a sprinter outside him, he's onside, you play it to the sprinter, he plays it in and Lukaku may get his objective, out of nowhere Chelsea get themselves rolling.</p>

<p>'His choice there to stop, return and pass it as far as possible back, I can't really accept that what I'm seeing.'</p>

<p>'It doesn't look a cheerful camp to me,' Shearer added.</p>

<p>'Such a large number of players waving their arms around, avoiding any responsibility, searching for pardons, not even close to sufficient in forward positions according to a Chelsea perspective.</p>

<p>'I believe he has issues in that Chelsea changing area that need figuring out and require figuring out speedy.</p>

<p>Shearer accepts there is a 'issue' in the changing area because of the absence of festivity for Hakim Ziyech's opener</p>

<p>'It wouldn't be the initial time in Chelsea's set of experiences that they've had issues in the changing area and we realize what happens when that happens.</p>

<p>'At the point when the ball hits the rear of the net view Lukaku, Hudson-Odoi, Kante, their absence of festivity, their absence of response, they're strolling back, heads down, there's nothing in it.</p>

<p>'Remembering you work practically the entire week to score objectives and you've quite recently scored the initial objective in the game, I was truly amazed. I needn't bother with any more proof, that lets me know there's an issue in the Chelsea changing area.'</p>
