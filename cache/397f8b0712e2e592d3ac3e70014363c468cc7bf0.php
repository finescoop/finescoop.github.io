<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Birmingham were battered 6-2 yet still left away inclination like they'd got off delicately.</p>

<p>For the third time in seven days, Fulham were in that heartless sort of mind-set where quite a few objectives appeared to be conceivable.</p>

<p>After seven at Reading, six against Bristol City, and six again here. Obviously, that was above and beyond to take them five focuses clear at the highest point of the Championship.</p>

<p>Fabio Carvalho (R) and Antonee Robinson (L) were both on track in the 6-2 pounding</p>

<p>Birmingham were the most recent survivors of Fulham's determined goalscoring streak</p>

<p>After a Marc Roberts own objective set them on their way, strikes from Neeskens Kebano, Fabio Carvalho and Tom Cairney settled it before half-time. Carvalho scored a late fifth after Birmingham had answered two times before Antonee Robinson adjusted it.</p>

<p>So that is the 19 objectives in a short time of football. All things considered, that can be classed as an agreeable week for Marco Silva and his group.</p>

<p>After a tacky fix in December, Fulham have thundered back to their best and have again pulled clear of Bournemouth and Blackburn at the top. Proceed in this rich vein and they'll walk around to easy street.</p>

<p>As ensuing occasions would emphasize, Fulham are more than equipped for scoring objectives without being given some assistance.</p>

<p>Seven evenings prior at Reading they were gifted the first of seven objectives by a loathsome backpass by Josh Laurent. This time, Birmingham presented an own objective, but an unfortunate one.</p>

<p>Only 10 minutes had slipped by and the guests had looked really compromising yet when Cairney played a pass that diverted off Carvalho and into the way of Harry Wilson, Birmingham were in a wide difficult situation.</p>

<p>Wilson's low cross would most likely have been turned in by the lurking Aleksandar Mitrovic however Roberts applied the completion for him as he slid in at the close to post to attempt to catch the cross.</p>

<p>Neeskens Kebano took in behind to hammer his shot high into the net and score Fulham's second</p>

<p>The early objective provided Fulham with a lot of control however we had the ridiculous circumstance of them arriving at the half hour without really having their very own injection.</p>

<p>That was before long amended as they shook in three objectives in a brief spell that Birmingham will have bad dreams about for a long time to come.</p>

<p>The second was like the first. Tosin Adarabioyo tracked down Wilson with a ball from the back and the underlapping run of Denis Odoi was chosen.</p>

<p>His cross was firm and low, ideal for Kebano to take in behind and hammer his shot high into the net.</p>

<p>Two became three in seemingly a heartbeat as the dam burst. The development this time was on the left side, with Kebano standing by calmly for Robinson's cross-over prior to liberating him.</p>

<p>Antonee Robinson commends putting the what tops off an already good thing with the last kick of the game</p>

<p>Fulham (4-2-3-1): Rodak; Odoi, Ream, Adarabioyo, Robinson; Cairney (c) (Chalobah 69), Reed (Onomah 81); Wilson, Carvalho, Kebano (De Cordova Reid 68); Mitrovic</p>

<p>Robinson's cross was met with the most cultivated looking header via Carvalho, absolutely not awful for a 19-year-old and one more sign of why he's evaluated so exceptionally at Craven Cottage and then some.</p>

<p>Serenades of 'we need seven' reverberated around the wooden seats of the Johnny Haynes Stand. The players appeared to respond to the call and nearly made it happen.</p>

<p>The fourth came a few minutes before half-time with Fulham essentially playing with the Birmingham protection. They worked the ball from the left to the right and back once more.</p>

<p>Wilson drove across the edge of the container searching for a shooting point, surrendered and passed to Kebano. He moved it on to Cairney who cleared a left-footed shot into the base corner.</p>

<p>Incongruity of incongruities, the best objective of the primary half came from Birmingham. In stoppage time, Ivan Sunjic gathered a pass infield from Jeremie Bela on the left, gazed upward and twisted home a perfect shot off the post.</p>

<p>'We will win five-four,' sang the away area, not terrified of some hangman's tree humor.</p>

<p>So Fulham strolled in for half-time having scored 17 objectives in a short time of football, more than base set Barnsley have dealt with throughout the season.</p>

<p>Birmingham secured everything for the final part and things quieted. Fulham appeared to be happy with their parcel for a fun time.</p>

<p>Carvalho couldn't create sufficient ability to beat Neil Etheridge after Wilson flicked the ball to him right fresh.</p>

<p>Fulham fans recited 'we need seven' and the players appeared to respond to the call</p>

<p>So would the guests be able to make the challenge somewhat really intriguing? Indeed, really. With 17 minutes left, Gardner bored in Birmingham's second from Kristian Pedersen's pass.</p>

<p>That was what could be compared to pushing a hornet's home. Fulham immediately broke forward and Carvalho took a pass from Bobby De Cordova Reid prior to choosing the base corner.</p>

<p>The what tops off an already good thing came when Robinson terminated home left-footed with essentially the last kick of the game.</p>
