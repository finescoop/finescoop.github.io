<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Lawrence Okolie could at long last face Mairis Briedis in a cruiserweight unification conflict this mid year on the off chance that the two warriors make it past their next battles - as per the Latvian star's advertiser Kalle Sauerland.</p>

<p>English star Okolie right now holds the WBO cruiserweight world title belt, while Briedis holds the IBF title - and the two contenders have been asked to venture into the ring to bind together the titles in what might be exceptionally expected standoff.</p>

<p>The two warriors have communicated an interest in finishing the arrangement - however Okolie should first face Michal Cieslak one month from now, while Briedis has an obligatory safeguard against Jai Opetaia in Australia. In any case, Sauerland demands the battle can occur when this mid year should the two men make it past their next challenges.</p>

<p>Lawrence Okolie (L) and Mairis Briedis (R) would last settle their score in a cruiserweight unification be able to conflict this mid year, as indicated by the Latvian's advertiser</p>

<p>Kalle Sauerland says he sees 'not an obvious explanation for' why it can't occur if the two of them endure their next compulsory protections</p>

<p>'Okolie is a battle we have checked out and discussed,' Sauerland told Sportsmail.</p>

<p>'They've said we haven't made a proposition. It's very straightforward. We've been examining the battle with Eddie [Hearn] for about a year. We were told there would be a proposition approaching, then, at that point, we got a required, which will be Jai Opetaia in Australia. That will be in March or April, then, at that point, we're free.</p>

<p>'They have a battle against Cieslak - we'll get past our battle, they'll overcome their battle. We have a decent connection with [Okolie's promoters] Matchroom and there's no great explanation that battle can't occur in the late spring.'</p>

<p>Notwithstanding every one of the calls for Okolie and Briedis to get serious, it appears to be the IBF champion - who has only one loss on his record, a greater part choice misfortune to Oleksandr Usyk - is occupied by a potential rewarding battle in the United States.</p>

<p>English star Okolie will safeguard his WBO title against Michal Cieslak one month from now yet has proclaimed his advantage in taking on the dreaded Briedis</p>

<p>Briedis is set to make a trip to Australia in the Spring to fight Jai Opetaia yet needs Okolie later</p>

<p>He took mind boggling measures to get down on YouTuber Jake Paul - getting a tattoo to challenge him, which peruses 'Jake's terrible karma', and has stir up the flares further - posting a video wishing him cheerful birthday and vowing to 'kick his a**'.</p>

<p>His adversary Okolie, unbeaten with 17 straight triumphs, promptly jumped on the image of his new ink - which became a web sensation - calling it 'humiliating' and blaming him for 'selling his spirit'.</p>

<p>'I thought it must be phony,' he told talkSport. 'I will message him secretly and see whether that is a genuine or phony tattoo. Since, in such a case that it's a genuine tattoo it's humiliating, assuming it's phony it's humiliating too.</p>

<p>'To now be somewhat selling your spirit for likes and retweets and a touch of clout fundamentally - you're an all around regarded individual in your nation and a 37-year-elderly person, pursuing a 24-year-old YouTuber who's a fledgling fighter, it's confounding.'</p>

<p>Notwithstanding, Briedis has gotten down on YouTuber Jake Paul via online media as of late - and Sauerland says he is not kidding about the rewarding session</p>

<p>Yet, while Sauerland excused the trick as 'whimsical', he said his warrior was for sure genuine turning around Paul because of the monetary ramifications it would involved - conceding he would 'be on the main plane to New York' assuming he got a proposal from the American's group.</p>

<p>'It's a kept quiet in cheek with Jake Paul,' he added, 'It's a genuine tattoo. You know, there's great laser shops nowadays...</p>

<p>'He's a piece exhausted in lockdown in Latvia, he's preparation consistently and I believe he's simply truly seen this person say he needs to battle fighters, he has energized and thought - "he's a simple battle and economically it's extremely intriguing so what difference would it make?"</p>

<p>Briedis amazingly got a tattoo perusing 'awful karma' to call out the American in a video posted via online media last week</p>

<p>A post common by Kalle and Nisse Sauerland (<?php echo e('@'); ?>sauerlandbros)</p>

<p>'I told Mairis - "help me out, is this completed now with Paul?" He said, "no, why?"</p>

<p>'Eddie Hearn said it was humiliating, yet assuming that Jake Paul hit us up now, I'd be on the primary plane to New York! Briedis can get ready for that in his instructional course for his next appropriate battle.'</p>

<p>However, Sauerland yielded that the liklihood of the battle really occurring is remote - saying he is yet to get a proposition and accepts Paul would evade from the test after an essentially look at Briedis' knockout reel.</p>

<p>'Mairis is getting a kick out of the response, the tattoo had great many preferences,' he said. 'I believe he's not kidding about battling him, however I don't think Jake Paul is going to him. My telephone has not rung. I'm certain he's googled Briedis knockouts and he'll reconsider.'</p>
