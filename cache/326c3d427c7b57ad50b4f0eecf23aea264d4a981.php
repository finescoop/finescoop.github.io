<p>'It's an alternate association and he is playing for perhaps the greatest club on the planet.

<p>'It's unique assuming you come as a 18-year-old, obscure capable English kid to Borussia Dortmund. From that point on, you can improve. You can make a triumph out of that.</p>

<p>'He can do that, there is no question regarding that. In any case, presently we need to form him into that sort of player and the very sort of exhibitions that he has displayed at Borussia Dortmund.'</p>
