<p>Alan Shearer (L) hit back at Thomas Tuchel for asserting Chelsea were 'worn out' against Brighton</p>

<p>Shearer called attention to that Chelsea's seat was worth £220m and ought to have fared better</p>

<p>'Indeed, even in the response of the objective you can see we were drained. We were assuaged we had the objective yet it dislike the unadulterated euphoria since they are saving energy.</p>

<p>'That is my sensation existing apart from everything else and of the group at this moment.'</p>

<p>However, Shearer gave a searing reaction to the German's reason, saying each group in world football faces testing conditions as of now - and that Chelsea ought to be one of the most outstanding furnished groups to manage exhaustion because of the profundity in their crew and how much cash they have spread out.</p>

<p>'Try not to acknowledge that, I'm not having that,' Shearer told BT Sport.</p>

<p>Hakim Ziyech didn't praise his objective, driving Tuchel to guarantee the group were saving energy</p>

<p>Shearer accepts the genuine justification behind Chelsea's helpless presentation was because of an absence of certainty</p>

<p>'I get it's been a difficult stretch for each football club on the planet, they've all had undeniably challenging conditions, as has everybody, not simply football.</p>

<p>'Yet, he has a seat this evening that is worth £220million. Kovacic, Havertz, Werner, Pulisic… [Tuchel] forgot about Mount on Saturday, brought Mount back in this evening.'</p>

<p>All things considered, Shearer feels the Blues are lacking in certainty and scrutinized the solidarity in the dressing rooom after Ziyech's surly reaction to scoring prior to being engaged with a warmed conversation with Romelu Lukaku.</p>

<p>'That presentation, absolutely going ahead, was not a worn out exhibition,' he added.</p>

<p>'That exhibition going ahead was a group that is truly battling on certainty and I don't know that they're all in total agreement.</p>

<p>'That for me is the reason it was a terrible showing.'</p>
