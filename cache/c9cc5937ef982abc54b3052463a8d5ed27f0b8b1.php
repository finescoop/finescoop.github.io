<p>'This is what you play for,' Cole said on BT Sport. He's an awesome ability, he hasn't gotten down to business in the Premier League as it's altogether different to the Dutch association. Yet, the not celebrating... It doesn't sit well for him as a fellow.'</p>

<p>Cole said each player is troubled when playing routinely however praising objectives was a significant piece of being a footballer and feeling part of a group.</p>

<p>The strike from outside the area was just Ziyech's subsequent Premier League objective of the period</p>

<p>'Assuming he was in my group I'd say come on. You know when chaps are troubled and they're not playing. However, assuming that I fall off the seat and score an objective, it's an arrival of energy.'</p>

<p>'I was frustrated with the response to the objective, I think assuming you commend that with the fans it gives you a lightness for the following 10 minutes to proceed to take the game and put it to sleep. That is what Chelsea expected to do,' he said.</p>

<p>While Chelsea's players were soothed to start to lead the pack, Ziyech gave a numb articulation</p>

<p>'With all due regard they've dropped four focuses against a Brighton group who they should be taking four or six focuses from effectively to be trying for the title. What's more contrary to the rules they got an objective. That was an advantage, you go take the game, you put it to sleep. Indeed, even with the festival it's a level festival and it simply gives to partners doesn't it?'</p>

<p>Cole concurred, proposing that Ziyech responded as he did to make an impression on Thomas Tuchel however asking the player to zero in on his exhibitions all things being equal.</p>

<p>'At the point when you approach them [the fans] you want to celebrate in light of the fact that you've worked the entire week, you've done the blueprint, bang, you've scored an incredible objective,' Cole said.</p>

<p>'He would believe it's a message to the supervisor however the message is the objective, I ought to play. Appreciate it, you could truly arouse the gathering here with a 1-0 win in an extreme, intense game and you're out of the droop.</p>

<p>Previous Brighton striker Glenn Murray said praising the objective would have given Chelsea a lift</p>

<p>'He's clearly got things he's not content with, however keep how you're treating the pitch, influence the game and you'll play consistently. At Chelsea it's uncommon you get players who play in that position who plays consistently. You need the chaps to simply appreciate it a little, drop the weight and proceed to play.'</p>

<p>Nonetheless, Cole said he was not excessively stressed by Ziyech's response yet felt the group would profit from their forthcoming excursion to play the Club World Cup in the UAE.</p>

<p>'It's not concerning, the club are going to CWC and that will be a decent chance for the club to move away in light of the fact that the outcomes have not been what they need and we need.</p>

<p>'So move away, get the chaps together, on the grounds that this group just six or seven months prior were heroes of Europe. They effectively won the last against extraordinary Manchester City players. There's as yet extraordinary players in there so they simply need to get back on the track and back in the correct course.'</p>

<p>Mentor Thomas Tuchel said he didn't care about Ziyech's festival yet simply needed him to score</p>

<p>Chelsea supervisor Tuchel demanded he was not troubled by Ziyech's muffled response to scoring and said he could celebrate anyway he wished as long as he continued to view as the net.</p>

<p>The German additionally made light of Ziyech's energized conversation with Romelu Lukaku at half-time.</p>

<p>'I'm cheerful. He can score 20 additional and not observe I have no issue,' Tuchel said cheerfully prior to conceding his side were deficient with regards to a touch of energy in the midst of a run of just one win in their last seven Premier League games.</p>

<p>'It is generally expected that they talk, are distraught and would rather avoid it assuming we say we need more from them. Indeed, even in the response for the objective you can see they are drained. It is alleviation. That is my sensation of the group a few seconds ago.'</p>
