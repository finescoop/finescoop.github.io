<p>The White House warned yesterday the circumstance was 'very risky's and that Moscow could send off an assault 'anytime'.</p>

<p>It had been idea Putin would pick the 'basic choice' of sending troops into the Donbass locale in south-eastern Ukraine and afterward haggle for it to turn into a free state, giving a cushion between supportive of western Ukraine and Russia.</p>

<p>As the area is as of now involved by favorable to Russian separatists, and has been in a condition of battle starting around 2014, it was accepted it would offer little obstruction.</p>

<p>'It is the horrible situation.'</p>

<p>Putin knows that as Ukraine doesn't have a place with Nato, there will be no tactical reaction by Western states.</p>
