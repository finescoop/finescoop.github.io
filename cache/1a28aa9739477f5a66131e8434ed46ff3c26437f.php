<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>This is the second a couple of rush looking for base jumpers sent off themselves from a 3280ft high bluff face into an overcast void on a solitary parachute.</p>

<p>Tom Newberry, 32, and Callum Coldwell-Story, recorded themselves hopping from one of the pinnacles of Mount Brento, Italy.</p>

<p>Film shows the pair, who recorded themselves with an Insta360 One X appended to Tom's protective cap, as they become encircled by thick mists and mist.</p>

<p>After they hopped Callum slid down to hang from Tom's legs, prior to grasping his hand and afterward giving up to freefall into the void.</p>

<p>Tom Newberry, 32, and Callum Coldwell-Story recorded themselves hopping from one of the pinnacles of Mount Brento, Italy in September</p>

<p>Tom had an Insta360 One X connected to his cap which offered a perspective on all the activity</p>

<p>Callum slid down to hang from Tom's legs, prior to grasping his hand and afterward allowing to go to free fall into the chasm</p>

<p>They were playing out a trick known as a 'Mr Bill', where two skydivers fly on a similar parachute.</p>

<p>Seconds in the wake of hopping Callum directed his parachute away from the bluff face and out towards the darkened valley.</p>

<p>When the pair cleared the cloud, the valley opened up underneath them and Callum started to move himself, unfastening himself from the tackle.</p>

<p>He slid down Tom's legs and hung in the air prior to talking his hand and giving up and falling quickly towards the earth.</p>

<p>Minutes before the finish of the video it is feasible to see the little spot of Callum's parachute far beneath.</p>

<p>Tom, an instructor from Exeter, Devon, said: 'We had been in Italy preparing our abilities prior to making a beeline for the Swiss Alps.</p>

<p>'Towards the week's end we needed to accomplish something more fun so we concocted the arrangement, no thought whether or not it would work.</p>

<p>'As you can see from the gigantic grins, loads of fun was had on this leap!'</p>

<p>The recording, which has as of late arisen on the web, was shot on September 17 last year.</p>

<p>Callum unstrapped himself from Tom's bridle and ready to free fall towards the valley underneath</p>

<p>Callum, envisioned, was joined to Tom's saddle until they explored their direction through the overcast cover that covered the valley</p>

<p>Minutes in the wake of giving up, Callum vanished from view into the valley beneath</p>
