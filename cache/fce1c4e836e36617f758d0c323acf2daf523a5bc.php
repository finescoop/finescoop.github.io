<p>To laugher in the Commons, Tory MP Philip Hollobone told Defense Minister James Heappey: 'This isn't Operation Red Meat, it's Operation Dog's Dinner.'</p>

<p>The plan was uncovered on Monday as Downing Street looked to retaliate against the desolates of partygate claims against the Prime Minister.</p>

<p>In the interim intends to fly transients to Africa were shredded after Ghana, one of the nations authorities said were in talks, said they didn't knew anything about it.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Defense (MoD) is relied upon to assume control over order of the activity from Border Force before the month's over in a move closed down by Prime Minister Boris Johnson.</p>

<p>In the mean time in Dover, Kent, a gathering including a youngster on board a little boat were met by Border Force only a couple hundred meters from the port.</p>

<p>Work MP Luke Pollard (Plymouth Sutton and Devonport) said: 'The sonic weapons, the long-range acoustic weapons, are now fitted to Border Force vessels, so as the Royal Navy has now accepted functional control of Border Force, would he be able to offer the expression that no Border Force sonic weapons will be utilized for traveler intersections?'</p>

<p>Mr Heappey answered: 'Assuming Border Force vessels are fitted with a capacity that the Royal Navy officer feels unseemly for use, then, at that point, he won't immediate that it is utilized, yet that is his judgment.'</p>
